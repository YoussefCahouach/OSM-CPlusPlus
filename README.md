# OSM-CPlusPlus

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
This project involves the development of a program in C++ that takes a map from Open Street Map and is capable of detecting all the establishments in the area and finding the shortest path between two establishments. This program is a powerful tool for navigating urban areas and finding the most efficient routes between different points of interest. By leveraging the data available on Open Street Map, this program provides users with up-to-date information about the locations of various establishments and the best ways to get from one to another.
